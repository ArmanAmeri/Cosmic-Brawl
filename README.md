## Overview

## Features

- **Special Attack**: Press G to unleash a powerful special move.


## Development  
This game was developed in **Godot Engine** over the course of three weeks as my first project using the engine. The focus was on creating solid core mechanics and experimenting with 2D game design in Godot. The development process involved:

- **Character Animation**: Using Godot's built-in animation system for character movement and combat.
- **Physics**: Implementing custom physics for platforming and interactions with weapons.

### Tech Stack
